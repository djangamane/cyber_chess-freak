Comparative Analysis: Planetary Chess vs. Other Racial Justice Initiatives 
This analysis evaluates how Planetary Chess differentiates itself from existing racial 
justice efforts across six dimensions: approach, technology, audience, knowledge 
dissemination, funding, and long-term strategy. 
1. Approach & Methodology 
Initiative 
The 1619 
Project 
Black Lives 
Matter 
Algorithmic 
Justice League 
Zinn Education 
Project 
Core Approach 
Historical education: 
Reframes U.S. history 
through slavery’s legacy. 
Grassroots activism: 
Protests, policy advocacy, 
community organizing. 
Tech accountability: 
Exposes bias in AI 
systems (e.g., facial 
recognition). 
Radical pedagogy: 
Provides anti-racist 
curricula for schools. 
Planetary Chess Differentiation 
Gamified systemic modeling: Uses 
chess/AI to simulate racism as a 
winnable game, not just a historical 
lesson. 
Counter-racist "war college": Combines 
Sun Tzu’s strategy with Black radical 
theory to train systemic "combatants." 
Offensive AI: Repurposes AI as a weapon 
against racism (e.g., LLM chatbot, news 
monitor). 
Multi-platform learning: Films, games, 
and DAOs replace classroom-only focus. 
Key Takeaway: While most initiatives focus on reacting to racism (e.g., protesting, policy 
reform), Planetary Chess models racism as a system to hack, gamify, and dismantle 
algorithmically. 
2. Technology Integration 
Initiative 
IBM Policy 
Lab 
Tech Use 
Predictive analytics: Models 
policy impacts on 
marginalized groups. 
Planetary Chess Differentiation 
AI as adversary: Players battle an AI 
(Stewie) that enforces systemic 
barriers in real time. 
BLM DAO 
Decentralized fundraising: 
Crypto for grassroots 
campaigns (largely defunct). 
Hate Crime 
(Game) 
Decolonize 
Art (NFTs) 
Narrative gaming: Teaches 
racism through story-driven 
gameplay. 
NFTs for land reclamation: 
Funds Indigenous causes via 
crypto art. 
DAO as governance: Funds and 
deploys counter-racist strategies via 
decentralized voting. 
Strategic gameplay: Uses chess 
mechanics to mirror systemic power 
dynamics (e.g., resource denial). 
NFTs as knowledge tokens: 
Tzuracializm art funds a 
self-replicating LLM/news database. 
Key Takeaway: Planetary Chess uniquely merges adversarial AI, decentralized 
governance, and NFTs into a single ecosystem—a “tech stack” for counter-racism. 
3. Audience Engagement 
Initiative 
The 1619 
Project 
Mission US 
(PBS) 
Equal 
Justice 
Initiative 
Primary Audience 
Educators/students: School 
districts, history buffs. 
K-12 students: Teaches 
history via interactive games. 
Legal professionals: Focuses 
on criminal justice reform. 
Planetary Chess Differentiation 
Multi-generational tiers: Engages 
gamers, academics, artists, and Web3 
users simultaneously. 
Adult-focused strategy: Targets 
policymakers and activists through AI 
tools/research, not just youth. 
Cultural bridge: Films and art attract 
non-activists, easing them into deeper 
engagement. 
Key Takeaway: Planetary Chess avoids siloing audiences (e.g., “academics only” or 
“protesters only”) by offering entry points for all literacies (visual, interactive, technical, 
scholarly). 
4. Knowledge Dissemination 
Initiative 
Knowledge Model 
Planetary Chess Differentiation 
Wikipedia 
Crowdsourced 
encyclopedia: Neutral, 
static articles. 
The Black 
Archives 
AJL’s Safe 
Face Pledge 
Historical preservation: 
Curates Black cultural 
artifacts. 
Toolkits for developers: 
Mitigates AI bias in tech 
products. 
Self-replicating LLM: AI updates 
counter-racist knowledge every 7 years, 
merging scholarship with real-time news. 
Cyclical warfare: Publishes evolving 
“volumes” of knowledge, treating racism 
as a shifting battlefield. 
AI as teacher: The “Unc” chatbot trains 
users in counter-racist strategy, not just 
ethics. 
Key Takeaway: Planetary Chess treats knowledge as a living, adaptive weapon—not just 
a static resource. 
5. Funding & Sustainability 
Initiative 
Color of 
Change 
DisCO.coop 
We, The 
People (NFTs) 
Funding Model 
Donations/grants: Relies on 
institutional philanthropy. 
Cooperative economics: 
Shared ownership models. 
Charity NFTs: Art sales fund 
existing orgs like Black Girls 
Code. 
Planetary Chess Differentiation 
NFT-fueled DAO: Decentralized 
funding tied to community 
governance (e.g., voters direct NFT 
proceeds). 
Play-to-earn mechanics: Gamers 
could earn crypto/NFTs for winning 
against systemic AI. 
NFTs as knowledge shares: 
Ownership supports a self-sustaining 
“counter-racist engine.” 
Key Takeaway: Planetary Chess avoids donor dependency by building a self-funding 
ecosystem (NFTs + DAO) that incentivizes participation. 
6. Long-Term Strategy 
Initiative 
Vision 
Planetary Chess Differentiation 
NAACP 
Policy advocacy: 
Centuries-old civil 
rights institution. 
#StopHateForProfit Corporate pressure: 
Boycotts against 
racist platforms. 
Critical Race Theory Academic framework: 
Analyzes systemic 
racism in institutions. 
Generational warfare: 7-year 
knowledge cycles outlast political eras, 
akin to Sun Tzu’s protracted 
campaigns. 
Systemic replacement: Builds parallel 
tools (LLM, DAO) to render oppressive 
systems obsolete. 
Operationalizable theory: Turns CRT 
into playbooks, chatbots, and AI 
models for direct action. 
Key Takeaway: Planetary Chess is designed as a perpetual motion machine—its AI, 
DAO, and cyclical publishing ensure it evolves faster than the systems it fights. 
Strategic Recommendations for Planetary Chess 
1. Leverage 501(c)(3) Status: Partner with schools to integrate the game/LLM into 
curricula, positioning it as the Khan Academy of Counter-Racism. 
2. Hybridize Funding: Blend NFT sales with grants (Ford Foundation, MacArthur) to 
avoid crypto volatility. 
3. Audit for Intersectionality: Ensure films/games address overlapping oppressions 
(race, gender, class). 
4. Build Alliances: Collaborate with AJL on AI ethics and DisCO.coop on DAO 
governance to share resources. 
Final Word 
Planetary Chess isn’t just another initiative—it’s a paradigm shift. By framing anti-racism 
as a strategic game that anyone can learn to “win,” it transcends the limitations of 
reactive activism, siloed education, and donor-driven models. Its greatest innovation? 
Treating systemic racism like software—a bug-ridden code that can be debugged, 
patched, and replaced. Now, the question is: Will the world hit "play"?
