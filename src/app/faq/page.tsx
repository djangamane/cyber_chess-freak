          <p>
            Planetary Chess stands apart from other racial justice initiatives by directly addressing the 
            root cause of racism: white supremacy as a systemic structure. Our approach is fundamentally 
            based on the scholarly work of Dr. Frances Cress Welsing and Dr. Amos Wilson, which provides 
            a comprehensive framework for understanding and dismantling racist systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Frederick Douglass noted, "Knowledge makes a man unfit to be a slave." Similarly, 
            Planetary Chess operates on the principle that accurate knowledge about white supremacy 
            is the most powerful tool for defeating it. We don't just discuss symptoms—we target 
            the underlying ideology and mechanisms that maintain racial hierarchies.
